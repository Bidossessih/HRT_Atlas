              Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas is a web-based tool with user-friendly interface for searching
              human and
              mouse housekeeping transcripts and genes. The workflow for the generation of the human database included
              the analysis of more than 11,000 high quality RNA-seq datasets, obtained from <a
                href="https://gtexportal.org/home/" target="_blank">GTEx</a> (version 7),
              a comprehensive public resource of tissue-specific gene expression. Data from 52 different tissue and
              cell types were obtained. In addition, data from 50 tissues and cell types were obtained from <a
                href="https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/index.html" target="_blank">ARCHS4</a>,
              a mining tool for public RNA-seq experiments.
              The generation of mouse database included the analysis of 507 high quality RNA-seq datasets manually
              curated from GEO database. Raw read counts were obtained from ARCHS4 repository. Samples of 14 tissues
              and cells types from wild type healthy control mice were included in the workflow.

              Users can download a complete list of housekeeping transcripts and genes built from our analysis of
              more than 11,000 high quality human RNA-seq datasets and 507 mouse datasets. Alternatively, they can
              search for the most suitable candidate reference transcripts to normalize their qPCR experiments. These
              candidate reference
              transcripts represent the most stable transcripts for each of the different tissues or cell types
              available in our database (102 and 22 for human and mouse respectively). In addition, specific primers
              for some of these transcripts are also provided and validated following MIQE guidelines. In the download
              page, it also provides a short
              list of reference transcripts stably expressed at low variability in all of the tissue or cell types.
              This list is provided to normalize tissue or cell types that cannot be accessed from our database.
              As diseases and small molecules are known to affect gene expression variability,
              we also integrated and manually curated three functional associations datasets from <a
                href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome/" target="_blank">Harmonizome</a>
              database. These datasets show for each human housekeeping gene, a list of known diseases and
              molecules that can modify their expression stability (based on differential expression) and intend
              to guide users in the choice of suitable reference genes for qPCR normalization.

              In addition, HRT Atlas has been integrated with EpiRegio REST API.
              <a href="https://epiregio.de/">EpiRegio</a> is a resource of Regulatory
              EleMents (REMs) that are able to regulate the expression of their
              target genes in different cell types and tissues.

              A gene is a genomic locus where transcription occurs and which may have one or more protein-coding
              isoform and/or non-coding transcripts. In Ensembl annotation process, a gene includes any spliced
              transcripts with overlapping coding sequence. That way, transcripts clustered into the same gene differ
              in their genomic coordinates (transcription start and end sites), splice events and exons number and
              sequences. The image below shows an illustrative example of transcripts that belong to GAPDH. Non-coding
              transcripts are shown in blue. All other are transcripts are annotated protein-coding transcripts.

            <p>
              Housekeeping genes have been classically defined as genes that are required for the maintenance
              of essential functions of any cell type. Hence, they are expected to be constitutively expressed
              in all cells and at any development stage. In Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas, a housekeeping
              gene
              is defined as a gene that has at least one of its protein-coding transcripts expressed in all cell
              types or tissues, with low variability (and non-zero level). Each of these transcripts may be specific
              to a subset of tissue or cell types. Transcripts belonging to these housekeeping genes are considered
              housekeeping transcripts. The housekeeping transcripts must have additionally a non-zero expression
              in all of the samples analyzed.
            </p>
            <br>

            The following criteria were applied to select the list of housekeeping genes, which should fulfill all three
            criteria:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>The gene must be expressed at non-zero level in all tissue and cell types included in our analysis (52
                and 14 cells and tissues for human and mouse respectively). This means that at least one of its
                transcripts must have an expression level higher than 1 <a
                  href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/glossary/rpkm" target="_blank">RPKM</a> (reads per
                kilobase
                million)</li>
              <li>Variability of gene expression should be low within all tissues and cell types, as evidence by a
                standard deviation of the log2 RPKM &#8826; 1</li>
              <li>Maximum fold change (MFC), represented by the ratio between log2 of maximum and log2 of mean RPKM of
                any
                of its transcripts, must be lower than 2. Thus, only genes whose expression level in all samples fall
                within a
                very narrow range are classified as housekeeping genes.</li>

            </ul>


            Only transcripts with well-supported transcript models were included in the database. As pseudogenes
            expression may affect the variability of their associated genes, genes with known pseudogenes were also
            excluded from the lists of reference transcripts proposed for qPCR experiment normalization.

              We proposed the term <a class="font-weight-bold">reference transcript</a> to define transcripts that are
              suitable for qPCR normalization
              in a particular tissue type. These transcripts were selected from the list of the newly described HK
              transcripts and have
              also a very low variability (log2 of maximum RPKM &#8826; 2 x log2 of minimum RPKM and standard deviation
              &#8826; 0.5) in specific
              tissue types, but not necessary in all of the tissues included in the database.
              Candidate reference transcripts stability was ranked based on mean RPKM, standard deviation of log2 RPKM
              and
              MFC value.
              Giving n transcripts, three intermediate scores (k=3) with equal weight are generated (score-1, score-2,
              and
              score-3 for RKPM, standard deviation and MFC, respectively for each transcript). Score-1 assigns n to the
              highest
              expressed transcript, estimated by mean RPKM, and 1 to the lowest expressed. Similarly, for score-2 and
              score-3 the
              highest scoring transcripts are the one that have the lowest standard deviation or the lowest MFC. Given
              sct,i
              the score of the transcript t for the i-th rank, we express the Score Product (SP) via the geometric mean:
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="www/images/formula.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            The highest scoring transcript is one that has the highest SP and is assigned to the first position (rank =
            1).
            That way, the n-th transcript is the one that has the lowest SP. The Score Product is proportional to the
            variability.

              Lists of housekeeping genes and transcripts were generated based on the criteria described above
              (<i>“Criteria for housekeeping genes and transcripts selection”</i> section).
              The housekeeping transcript list was then used to provide a list of suitable references for qPCR
              experiment
              normalization for each tissue and cell type. Some transcripts specific primers were also designed. All of
              the generated matrixes were used to construct a SQLite database.
              Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas is a web tool developed with Shiny package and hosted by Shiny
              Server. The application front-end is implemented by HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4. All of the components were
              encapsulated in a deployable Docker container running on an Unix-based operating system with Apache HTTP
              server. Users
              instructions communicated to the container are processed by R and the request is sent to the SQLite
              database
              mounted as a container volume. Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas offers a user friendly and
              reactive interface to provide the best using experience.

              The search interface allows searching suitable reference transcripts for qPCR normalization by selecting
              one of the 82 tissues or cell types included in our database. By clicking on the search box, the full list
              of cells and tissues is automatically displayed on the screen ("Screenshot showing inputs of the search box").
              <br>
              From this interface users can also access and download the complete list of housekeeping transcripts and
              housekeeping genes as shown below. A similar interface is provided for mouse database.

                The results page shows the list of reference transcripts for the selected tissue or
                cell type. Each transcript is identified by its Ensembl code, followed by the gene symbol.
                The expression level of each transcript is expressed as the mean value of reads per kilobase million
                (RPKM) for the specific tissue or cell type. Variability and maximum fold-change are expressed as the
                standard deviation of the log2 RPKM, and the ratio of log2(maximum RPKM)/ log2(mean RPKM), respectively.
                By default, results are ranked by the criteria described above (“How results are ranked?” section).
                Alternatively, transcripts can be ranked
                by the user by clicking in the arrow next to any of these parameters.
                Users can select the number of transcripts to be shown per page, and then download the full list displayed
                on the screen in their preferred format (csv, Excel or Pdf). Finally user is allowed to
                filter de candidate reference transcript table by disabling the logarithmic normalization option.
                A minimum valor of RPKM can also be defined. The default is 30.
